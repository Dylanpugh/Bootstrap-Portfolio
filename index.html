            <p class="card-body font-italic font-weight-bold text-secondary">My name is Dylan Pugh. I just recently moved back from California, where i lived for over 3 years.
            My time in California was awesome, I learned how to surf, snowboard, and bartend. I would surf everyday, it became a ritual for me.
            Also, I was able to become a barback at an upscale restaurant, which soon led me into bartending. Now, I just recently moved back home to Marietta, GA, which is where i grew up. 
            As much as I loved California, it never felt like home. I am currently looking for a career change, which led me to join the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp.
